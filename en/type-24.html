<h2 id="snapshot">Snapshot</h2>
<p>The Movement Icon has massive recognition and
              a loyal network, plus real skills and lived expertise, yet the economic base
              is thin. They are the public face of a cause, a craft, or a community-led
              field, often respected far beyond their bank balance. Their influence is
              real, but the lack of financial buffer makes the entire structure fragile.
            </p>
<h2 id="great-at">What You're Great At</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Mobilizing people fast through trust, story, and shared identity.</li>
              <li>Turning complex ideas into narratives that communities can carry.</li>
              <li>Building high-density networks with real reciprocity.</li>
              <li>Maintaining authenticity, a scarce currency in 2025.</li>
              <li>Mentoring and training others, creating second-generation leaders.</li>
            </ul>
<h2 id="trips-you-up">What Trips You Up</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Burnout from carrying a movement while under-resourced.</li>
              <li>Guilt about charging, even when the work creates clear value.</li>
              <li>High exposure to economic shocks because the buffer is thin.</li>
              <li>Being courted by elites who want your legitimacy more than your vision.</li>
              <li>Difficulty scaling because everything depends on your direct labor.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="bottleneck">Your Bottleneck</h2>
<p>Economic Capital (E). You have legitimacy,
              skill, and network, but you cannot buy time. Without a runway, the movement
              can become a treadmill: always active, never secure. Durability needs a
              financial engine.
            </p>
            <h2 id="lever">Your Lever</h2>
<p>Symbolic Capital (Y). Your name can convert
              attention into stable revenue if you build the right structure. Build an
              owned engine: memberships, licensing, workshops, cohorts, sponsorship decks,
              or a member-owned platform. Use Y to generate recurring E, then use E to
              protect S and scale C.
            </p>
<h2 id="plan-7">7-Day Plan</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Write a one-page value map of outcomes you already deliver.</li>
              <li>Draft a simple offer ladder: free, entry, core, premium.</li>
              <li>Identify 10 supporters who would join a membership to fund the mission.</li>
            </ul>
<h2 id="plan-30">30-Day Plan</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Launch a membership or cohort with recurring billing and clear benefits.</li>
              <li>Create a sponsorship deck aligned to your values and boundaries.</li>
              <li>Build a small operations role to reduce your direct load.</li>
            </ul>
<h2 id="plan-90">90-Day Plan</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Create one scalable asset: toolkit, curriculum, index, or platform.</li>
              <li>Secure two aligned sponsors or institutional partners with guardrails.</li>
              <li>Set up governance so the community retains control and you retain time.</li>
            </ul>
<h2 id="mini-stories">Mini-Stories</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Success Story:</strong> A respected community leader (Y, S, C)
              launches a member-backed cohort. Within three months, recurring income (E)
              allows a small team to form, burnout drops, and the movement becomes
              infrastructure instead of hustle.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Failure Story:</strong> A movement icon refuses to build a revenue
              engine. When costs rise and donations fall, stress spikes. The community
              splinters, not from lack of love, but from lack of runway.
            </p>
<h2 id="upgrade-checklist">Fast Upgrade Checklist</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Build an offer ladder.</li>
              <li>Launch membership or cohort.</li>
              <li>Create a sponsorship deck.</li>
              <li>Set boundaries in writing.</li>
              <li>Add one operations helper.</li>
              <li>Build one scalable asset.</li>
              <li>Create governance rules.</li>
              <li>Track burnout signals.</li>
              <li>Diversify income streams.</li>
              <li>Protect authenticity with structure.</li>
            </ul>
<h2 id="best-fits">Best Fits</h2>
            <p>Movement leaders, creator-educators, community founders, public intellectuals, union-style organizers in digital fields.</p>
<h2 id="watch-outs">Watch Outs</h2>
            <p>Being used as legitimacy by richer players; burnout; shame around monetization; over-dependence on personal labor.</p>

            <h2 id="motto">One-Line Motto</h2>
<p>My voice moves people; now my structure must protect the mission.</p>
<div class="type-addon">
              <h2 id="addon">Type Add-On</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Full Scope Add-On.</strong> You are the kind of leader the field
                cannot manufacture. You earned trust the hard way, through time and
                consistency. That trust is an asset, yet it can become a chain if you
                refuse to convert it into runway.
              </p>
              <p>
                A movement with no runway becomes reactive. It cannot plan, defend, or
                endure. Your upgrade is simple: build a financial spine that keeps your
                work free from capture.
              </p>

              <h5>How You Know You Are Stalling</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>You keep surviving instead of building.</li>
                <li>You feel guilty charging for value that clearly helps others.</li>
                <li>You fear that one bad month could collapse the whole system.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>365-Day Map</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Days 1-30: Create your offer ladder and boundaries in writing.</li>
                <li>Days 31-90: Launch recurring income and stabilize your baseline.</li>
                <li>Days 91-180: Build one scalable asset and delegate operations.</li>
                <li>Days 181-270: Secure aligned partners with guardrails.</li>
                <li>Days 271-365: Institutionalize durability with governance and repeatable revenue.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>Weekly Cadence</h5>
              <p>One revenue action, one community action, one creation action, one recovery action.</p>

              <h5>Scoreboard</h5>
              <p>Recurring revenue, lower burnout, stronger autonomy, stronger community retention.</p>
