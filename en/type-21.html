<h2 id="snapshot">Snapshot</h2>
<p>The Elite Graduate is a crowned striver with
              skills and money but is socially isolated. They are the star student who
              went into high-paying roles but lost touch with the community. Their status
              is massive but their social base is thin.
            </p>
<h2 id="great-at">What You're Great At</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Performing high-status technical work within elite hierarchies.</li>
              <li>Maintaining a high-status embodied cultural habitus.</li>
              <li>Leveraging institutionalized cultural capital to secure E.</li>
              <li>Adhering to elite professional etiquette of the old guard.</li>
              <li>Managing symbolic reputation through prestige signals.</li>
            </ul>
<h2 id="trips-you-up">What Trips You Up</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Rule-following when the field is moving to decentralized rule-breaking.</li>
              <li>Lack of bridging ties outside the elite ivory tower.</li>
              <li>Imposter syndrome due to misrecognition of your own capital.</li>
              <li>Network atrophy from a shrinking circle of elite alumni.</li>
              <li>Vulnerability to symbolic violence from grassroots movements.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="bottleneck">Your Bottleneck</h2>
<p>Social Capital (S). You have the crown,
              but no kingdom. You are a lone star. You lack reciprocity and social buffer
              that comes from community membership. In a 2025 field defined by collective
              action, your isolation is your ceiling.
            </p>
            <h2 id="lever">Your Lever</h2>
<p>Symbolic Capital (Y). Use your status to invite
              others in. Be the person who bestows prestige on younger strivers. By
              trading Y for S (mentorship, grants, hosting), you create a loyal tribe that
              secures your symbolic power for the next cycle.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Success Story:</strong> A star lawyer (Y, C, E) realizes he has no
              allies. He starts a law-tech incubator for students (S). This network becomes

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Failure Story:</strong> An elite AI researcher (Y, C, E) stays in
              his ivory tower. He refuses to engage with the open-source community (S).

              a fancy title and no friends.

            <h2 id="motto">One-Line Motto</h2>
<p>I have reached the top; now I must build the bridge.</p>
<div class="type-addon">
              <h2 id="addon">Type Add-On</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Full Scope Add-On.</strong> You climbed the ladder and earned the
                crown. The tradeoff is isolation and the slow shrinking of your world. In
                2025, elite status can become a bubble that keeps you safe from criticism
                and blind to new value. Your move is mentorship and community building.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you grant status to others, you create loyalty, and loyalty protects
                your position when the field shifts.
              </p>

              <h5>How You Know You Are Stalling</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Your circle looks impressive but thin.</li>
                <li>You feel out of touch with emerging norms.</li>
                <li>You suspect people like your credentials more than you.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>365-Day Map</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Days 1-30: Offer mentorship to five juniors with clear structure.</li>
                <li>Days 31-90: Host a small dinner series for rising builders and creators.</li>
                <li>Days 91-180: Join a grassroots board that forces reality contact.</li>
                <li>Days 181-270: Co-build a project with a Community Powerhouse.</li>
                <li>Days 271-365: Institutionalize your bridge with a grant or fellowship.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>Weekly Cadence</h5>
              <p>Two mentorship touches, one community touch, one artifact touch, one humility check.</p>

              <h5>Scoreboard</h5>
              <p>Referrals, loyalty, early warnings, durable reputation beyond credentials.</p>
