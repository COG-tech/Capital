<h2 id="snapshot">Snapshot</h2>
<p>The Community Scholar possesses deep expertise
              and a loyal network but is cash-poor and unrecognized. They are the backbone
              of niche academic or activist communities, possessing aspirational capital
              but facing structural constraints. Their outcomes are dominant locally but
              ignored globally.
            </p>
<h2 id="great-at">What You're Great At</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Deep expertise in niche digital scholarship or community history.</li>
              <li>Building high-trust bridging ties across diverse demographic groups.</li>
              <li>Mentoring others and facilitating collective action.</li>
              <li>Maintaining authentic linguistic habitus that resonates with the grassroots.</li>
              <li>Creating high-value cultural goods for the public good.</li>
            </ul>
<h2 id="trips-you-up">What Trips You Up</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Burnout from performing unpaid labor in community contexts.</li>
              <li>Scarcity mindset due to lack of an economic buffer.</li>
              <li>Being misrecognized as an amateur by elite gatekeepers.</li>
              <li>Difficulty scaling impact due to lack of material tools.</li>
              <li>Vulnerability to economic shocks like high inflation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="bottleneck">Your Bottleneck</h2>
<p>Economic Capital (E). You are doing the
              work, but the work is not paying. You lack the material resources to buy
              time or invest in your own culture stack. Without E, your C and S remain
              localized and vulnerable to exhaustion.
            </p>
            <h2 id="lever">Your Lever</h2>
<p>Social Capital (S). Mobilize your network for
              capital generation. Use your high-trust S to launch a crowdfunding campaign
              or a member-owned enterprise. By trading S for E, you secure the material
              base to scale your C.
            </p>
<h2 id="plan-7">7-Day Plan</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Identify three patrons in your extended network who have E but lack your C/S.</li>
              <li>Audit your time to identify five hours of unpaid labor you can monetize.</li>
              <li>Update your rate card for specialized consulting.</li>
            </ul>
<h2 id="plan-30">30-Day Plan</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Launch a paid membership tier or specialized workshop for your community.</li>
              <li>Apply for three community grants using your social impact metrics.</li>
              <li>Partner with a Dealmaker to find monetization pathways for your C.</li>
            </ul>
<h2 id="plan-90">90-Day Plan</h2>
            <ul>

              <li>Secure a venture philanthropy grant to fund a dedicated culture stack.</li>
              <li>Publish your impact report to gain symbolic recognition from elite institutions.</li>
            </ul>
<h2 id="mini-stories">Mini-Stories</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Success Story:</strong> A local historian (C, S) with no budget (E)
              starts a heritage NFT project. Her community supports it, generating the
              funds she needs to publish her book and gain national recognition (Y).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Failure Story:</strong> A technical mentor (C, S) gives away all his
              time for free. He burns out (E remains 0), and eventually has to leave the
              field for a soul-crushing clerical job that AI automates.
            </p>

            <h2 id="motto">One-Line Motto</h2>
<p>My knowledge is deep and my people are many; I just need the means to keep going.</p>
<div class="type-addon">
              <h2 id="addon">Type Add-On</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Full Scope Add-On.</strong> You carry the memory of a field.
                People trust you because you show up and you care. Your weakness is not
                value. Your weakness is material constraint and the slow bleed of exhaustion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your social capital is real leverage. Use it to build a member-backed
                system that keeps you resourced and keeps the community independent.
              </p>

              <h5>How You Know You Are Stalling</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>You are always busy, rarely secure.</li>
                <li>You keep giving away core work for the mission.</li>
                <li>You feel tired and quietly bitter.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>365-Day Map</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Days 1-30: Define what is free and what is paid, then enforce it.</li>
                <li>Days 31-90: Launch one revenue channel: membership, workshop, consulting, sponsor deck.</li>
                <li>Days 91-180: Convert trust into stability with recurring income and clearer boundaries.</li>
                <li>Days 181-270: Create one scalable cultural asset: guide, toolkit, index, curriculum, archive.</li>
                <li>Days 271-365: Gain recognition with impact metrics and one institutional partner.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>Weekly Cadence</h5>
              <p>One monetized session, one community session, one creation session, one rest block.</p>

              <h5>Scoreboard</h5>
              <p>Recurring income, lower burnout, higher retention, stronger bargaining power.</p>
