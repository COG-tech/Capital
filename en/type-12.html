<h2 id="snapshot">Snapshot</h2>
<p>The Gatekeeper possesses the knowledge and
              institutional authority to define who is in or out, but is materially
              constrained. They are editors, curators, or admissions directors who control
              the meritocratic pipeline but do not own the means of production. Their
              power is institutional but their bank account is precarious.
            </p>
<h2 id="great-at">What You're Great At</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Setting field-level standards and rules for legitimacy.</li>
              <li>Recognizing and validating new talent through symbolic markers.</li>
              <li>Managing elite social graphs within established institutions.</li>
              <li>Performing embodied distinction that signals professional authority.</li>
              <li>Navigating institutionalized cultural capital hierarchies.</li>
            </ul>
<h2 id="trips-you-up">What Trips You Up</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Institutional dependence; if the organization fails, power vanishes.</li>
              <li>Misrecognizing new decentralized innovation as low-brow.</li>
              <li>Burnout from the emotional labor of gatekeeping.</li>
              <li>Low economic capital making you vulnerable to elite capture.</li>
              <li>Rigid habitus that struggles with the fluidity of agentic AI.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="bottleneck">Your Bottleneck</h2>
<p>Economic Capital (E). You have the power
              to say yes to others, but you cannot say yes to yourself. You are asset-poor,
              making you captive to the institution. Without E, you lack the independence
              to innovate outside the rules you learned.
            </p>
            <h2 id="lever">Your Lever</h2>
<p>Social Capital (S). You have access to kingmakers.
              Convert your S into E by moving into private strategy or elite recruiting.
              By trading your Gatekeeper status for high-end advisory fees, you secure the
              material independence you lack.

<h2 id="mini-stories">Mini-Stories</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Success Story:</strong> A senior editor at a tech journal (C, Y, S)
              realizes he is underpaid. He starts a strategic narrative consultancy for AI
              startups. His insider knowledge (C) and network (S) allow him to charge $50k
              per engagement.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Failure Story:</strong> A museum curator (C, Y, S) ignores her low
              bank balance. She continues to curate for free. When the museum is disrupted
              by a digital-first competitor, she is laid off with no personal financial buffer.

              <h2 id="addon">Type Add-On</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Full Scope Add-On.</strong> You can validate others while remaining
                financially constrained yourself. That creates a quiet resentment risk.
                The field runs through you, but the upside bypasses you. Your most powerful
                move is to step into advisory roles where your judgment becomes an asset
                with direct returns, not only institutional status.
              </p>
              <p>
                Do not abandon your ethics. Just stop letting the institution own the
                entire spread between your insight and its value.
              </p>

              <h5>How You Know You Are Stalling</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>You feel trapped by conflict-of-interest rules.</li>
                <li>You keep giving elite value for mid-tier income.</li>
                <li>You fear leaving because the title feels like safety.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>365-Day Map</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Days 1-30: Define your advisory lane and your ethics guardrails.</li>
                <li>Days 31-90: Register a separate brand entity and launch one advisory offering.</li>
                <li>Days 91-180: Build client proof and raise rates based on outcomes and access.</li>
                <li>Days 181-270: Secure equity exposure in projects you validate.</li>
                <li>Days 271-365: Move into a portfolio career with advisory and ownership.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>Weekly Cadence</h5>
              <p>One advisory outreach, one artifact creation, one network strengthening, one ethics review.</p>

              <h5>Scoreboard</h5>
              <p>Advisory income, equity positions, independence, reduced institutional fear.</p>
