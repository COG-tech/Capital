<p>The Community Powerhouse is the local leader
              with high trust and skills but is broke. They are the influential person in
              a decentralized collective who is status-rich but resource-poor. Their power
              is community-led but their economic base is constrained.
            </p>
<h2 id="great-at">What You're Great At</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Grassroots mobilization and high-trust community building.</li>
              <li>Bridging diverse demographic networks to reduce echo chambers.</li>
              <li>Performing embodied technical mastery applied to community needs.</li>
              <li>Managing decentralized social graphs and governance protocols.</li>
              <li>Resisting exclusionary symbolic power through resistance capital.</li>
            </ul>
<h2 id="trips-you-up">What Trips You Up</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Burnout from performing unpaid community labor.</li>
              <li>Scarcity mindset due to lack of a material buffer.</li>
              <li>Being misrecognized by elite E-dominant players as an amateur.</li>
              <li>Lack of independent materials to scale community impact.</li>
              <li>Network fatigue from managing dense, overlapping ties.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="bottleneck">Your Bottleneck</h2>
<p>Economic Capital (E). You have the people,
              but not the funds. You lead a group that cannot pay you. Without E, you are
              vulnerable to exhaustion and capture by larger institutions that seek your
              S for diversity but not power.
            </p>
            <h2 id="lever">Your Lever</h2>
<p>Symbolic Capital (Y). Use your community trust
              to create an economic engine. Launch a member-owned enterprise or an equity
              crowdfunding campaign. By trading Y for E, you secure the material independence
              required to protect your community's vision.
            </p>
<h2 id="plan-7">7-Day Plan</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Audit your community assets and the economic value you are creating.</li>
              <li>Identify three patrons who share your values and have E.</li>
              <li>Update your rate card for community strategy consulting.</li>
            </ul>
<h2 id="plan-30">30-Day Plan</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Launch a membership or equity campaign for a community project.</li>
              <li>Register your collective as a social enterprise or co-op.</li>
              <li>Partner with a Dealmaker to find sustainable monetization pathways.</li>
            </ul>
<h2 id="plan-90">90-Day Plan</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Transition from organizer to founder with a dedicated salary.</li>
              <li>Secure a venture philanthropy grant to fund a community culture stack.</li>
              <li>Publish your impact report to gain symbolic recognition from elite bodies.</li>
            </ul>
<h2 id="mini-stories">Mini-Stories</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Success Story:</strong> A leader of a digital artist collective
              (S, Y, C) realizes the group is broke. She launches a member-owned market.
              The platform's success (E) allows her to pay herself a salary and fund more
              C-dominant projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Failure Story:</strong> A community architect (S, Y, C) gives
              everything to the group. He refuses to monetize. When a major developer (E)
              buys the community's attention, he is left with nothing but prestige.
            </p>

<div class="type-addon">
              <h2 id="addon">Type Add-On</h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Full Scope Add-On.</strong> You are the heartbeat of a collective.
                People trust you and follow you because you build real belonging. That work
                is heavy. The field often romanticizes your labor while starving it. Your
                task is to build an economic engine that protects the community from capture
                and protects you from exhaustion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your symbolic capital is not decoration. It is a conversion tool. Use it
                to secure funds on your terms.
              </p>

              <h5>How You Know You Are Stalling</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>You do everything and still feel broke.</li>
                <li>You feel guilt when charging, even though the group depends on you.</li>
                <li>You are vulnerable to a better-funded outsider buying influence.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>365-Day Map</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Days 1-30: Define the community's economic value and write a clear offer.</li>
                <li>Days 31-90: Launch membership or revenue share and pay yourself first.</li>
                <li>Days 91-180: Register the structure as a co-op or social enterprise.</li>
                <li>Days 181-270: Build a sponsor deck and secure two aligned backers.</li>
                <li>Days 271-365: Scale infrastructure the community owns.</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>Weekly Cadence</h5>
              <p>One revenue action, one governance action, one community action, one rest action.</p>

              <h5>Scoreboard</h5>
              <p>Recurring income, lower burnout, stronger independence, stronger retention.</p>
